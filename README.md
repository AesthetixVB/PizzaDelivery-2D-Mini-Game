#Now titled 'Pizza Delivery System' with Personal assets to reflect change of theme and 2D Level design.

"Pizza Delivery System" is a game made from following GameDev.tv's 2D Unity Video Game Development course.

**Delivery Driver Project**

**Controls**: wasd/arrow keys.

This is my very first go around with game development Unity, and I may come back to it later after completing more projects and courses in order to turn it into a usable minigame. Stopping here in order to move on to other projects.

My plans if I come back to this:
- Add a basic tally up system that keeps track of how many packages were delivered.
- Add a basic UI/Menu with options like "play, settings, quit"
- Add an end game/restart UI screen after all the packages were delivered.
- Use a pointer that guides the player to packages and their respective customer.
- Add a timer that starts after picking up the package.
   - bonus: add emotes to represent customer's anger at certain time intervals.
- A way to lose the game by running out of time.
- Music and sound effects
- More maps/levels (atleast 4 more that increases in difficulty)
