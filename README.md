# This-Barbie-Delivers-2D-Mini-Game

"This Barbie Delivers" is a game made from GameDev.tv's assets and 2D Unity Video Game Development course.

**Delivery Driver Project**

**Controls**: wasd/arrow keys.

**Goal**: Find and deliver 6 packages scattered around map.

Once the package is picked up, deliver it to the customer (*blue circles*).

Avoid crashing and pick up *Gasoline* cans to give Barbie's car a boost.


This is my very first go around with game development Unity, and I may come back to it later after completing more projects and courses in order to turn it into a usable minigame. Stopping here in order to move on to other projects.

My plans if I come back to this:
- Add a basic tally up system that keeps track of how many packages were delivered.
- Add a basic UI/menu with options like "play, settings, quit"
- Add an end game/restart UI screen after all the packages were delivered.
- Use a pointer that guides the player to packages and their respective customer.
- Add a timer that starts after picking up the package.
   - bonus: add emotes to represent customer's anger at certain time intervals.
- A way to lose the game by running out of time.
- Music and sound effects
- More maps/levels (like 4 more that increases difficulty)
