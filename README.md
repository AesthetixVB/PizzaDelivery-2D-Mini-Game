## Future Plans (If I Return)

- Add a basic tally system that keeps track of how many packages were delivered.

- Add a timer that starts after picking up the package.
  - *Bonus*: Add emotes to represent customer's anger at certain time intervals.
- A way to lose the game by running out of time.
- Music and sound effects.
- More maps/levels (at least 4 more that increase in difficulty).
